\section{Background: Whatever the Background is}\label{sec:background}

Give a short, self-contained summary of necessary
background information. For example, assume you present an
implementation of sorting algorithms. You could organize into sorting
definition, algorithms considered, and asymptotic runtime statements. The goal of the
background section is to make the paper self-contained for an audience
as large as possible. As in every section
you start with a very brief overview of the section. Here it could be as follows: In this section 
we formally define the sorting problem we consider and introduce the algorithms we use
including a cost analysis.

\mypar{Sorting}
Precisely define sorting problem you consider.

\mypar{Sorting algorithms}
Explain the algorithm you use including their costs.

As an aside, don't talk about "the complexity of the algorithm.'' It's incorrect,
problems have a complexity, not algorithms.
