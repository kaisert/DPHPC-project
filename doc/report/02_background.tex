\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
We start this section by giving a brief introduction to the XML Path Language,
or XPath for short \cite{xpathSpec}. We continue by providing an overview
over three general approaches for XPath Query processing and discuss how our
solution relates to these approaches. In the end, we present a formal description
of the pushdown automatons that we use in our approach.

\subsection{XML Querying using XPath}
XPath models an XML document as a tree of nodes. An XPath query describes a set
of paths in this tree. We say a node in the tree \emph{matches} a query if the
path from the root to the node is contained in this set.

For our project we only considered a small subset of XPath. The expressiveness
of this subset is fairly limited compared to full XPath. However, we believe
that the concepts presented in this report can be extended in a canonical way
to support more expressive queries.

The grammar rules for the subset of XPath we chose are as follows:

\begin{align*}
    P &::= /N\ |\ //N\ |\ P\ P\\
    N &::= E\ |\ *
\end{align*}
where $E$ is an element name. In our terminology, a \emph{query list} is a list
of XPath queries. The following is an example of a query list containing two
XPath queries:

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\texttt{/a/b/c}\\
\texttt{//*/d}
\end{figure}

We can now give a formal definition of the problem we aim to solve and state
the goal of our enterprise. 

\mypar{Problem Definition and Goal} Given an XML document and a query list as
defined above, find all nodes that match any of the queries contained in the
query and report the character offsets in the XML document of the opening and
closing tags of these nodes. The goal is to maximize the throughput at which
the XML document is processed.

Consider the example XML document in Figure \ref{src:exampleXML}. Using the
above query, the matcher would return the character offsets of \verb;<c>; and
\verb;</c>;, and \verb;<d>; and \verb;</d>; for the first and second query,
respectively.

        <b>
            <c>
            </c>
        </b>
        <b>
            <d>
            </d>
        </b>
    </a>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Parallel XML Query Matching}
To decide whether a node matches a query, all characters of the XML stream
up to the corresponding tag must be read. In the following paragraphs, we briefly discuss
three commonly available techniques for processing XML data. The idea is not to
provide detailed technical insight, but rather to demonstrate the effect of the
aforementioned interdependence in these scenarios. We refer the reader to
\cite{Ogden2013} for a more elaborate discussion.

\mypar{XML parsing and querying} 
As XML is a context-free language, an XML
document can be parsed and represented as a parse tree. The actual query
matching is then performed on the parse tree.

There exist approaches to parallelize parse tree querying \cite{You11}. However,
in general, parsing an XML document in parallel requires the document to be
split into well-formed chunks, each containing a subtree of the complete parse tree.
This, in turn, can only be achieved through a sequential pre-parsing step.

An example for a parallel DOM tree parser that works on malformed XML chunks is
discussed in \cite{Shah09}. However, they only considered XML documents of
comparatively small size.

\mypar{XML capable DBMS}
Some relational DBMS engines (among them are MSQL,
MySQL, MonetDB) have support for indexing XML documents. While indexing enables
parallelized querying, creating the index structures imposes a large overhead,
as the XML document must first be read into the database and indexed.

\mypar{XML processing with automatons} 
A parser (e.g. a SAX-parser) reads the XML document and triggers parsing events
that are handled by a pushdown automaton. The pushdown automaton transitions
into an accepting state if one of the queries from the query list matches.

In the work of Ogden et al. \cite{Ogden2013}, which is the inspiration for this
project, each XML chunk is processed independently and a state mapping is
generated that maps each possible start state of the matching automaton to the
corresponding finishing state for this chunk. Only the start state of the first
chunk is known at the beginning. In a final sequential step, the mappings are
connected to find all matchings.

One advantage of this approach is that both, the parser and the automaton, need
to maintain only a comparatively small amount of state information. The authors of 
\cite{Ogden2013} compare their transducer-based approach to a PugiXML-based 
DOM tree parser:
While the transducer-based approach scales up to 64 cores, the DOM tree parser
only scales up to 30 cores, as DOM tree parsing induces a higher memory
bandwidth. 

\subsection{XPath Query Matching}
We used the same procedure to construct the deterministic pushdown automata as
in \cite{Ogden2013}: A query is turned into a deterministic finite state
automaton (dFSA) using the methods presented in \cite{Green2004}. The dFSA is
then turned into a pushdown automaton (or pushdown transducer).

A deterministic pushdown automaton is defined as a 6-tuple $(Q, q_0, \Sigma,
\Gamma, \delta, F)$ where $Q$ is the set of states, $q_0$ is the initial state,
$\Sigma$ is the input alphabet (the queried opening and closing XML tags and  
[unknown] for all other tags), $\Gamma$ is the pushdown alphabet, $\delta$ 
is the transition function, and $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states.

In our case, the pushdown alphabet $\Gamma$ is equal to the set of states $Q$.
Each opening tag leads to a push transition, i.e. the current state is pushed
onto the stack. Conversely, each closing tag corresponds to a pop transition
where the new state is the former top of the stack.

% Thus, the transition
% function consists of two parts, $\delta_{\text{push}}: Q \times \Sigma
% \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma$ and $\delta_{\text{pop}}: Q \times \Sigma \times
% \Gamma \rightarrow Q$.

\label{fig:exampleFSA}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:exampleFSA} shows the state diagram of a pushdown automaton
matching nodes of the query \verb;/a/b/c;. The state $0$ corresponds
to the illegal state. This state is reached when no subsequent input characters
can lead to a match (e.g., when an opening tag \verb;<d>; is read in this
case). The transitions labeled \verb;[o]; match all input characters for which
there are no specific transitions. The pop transitions are omitted for brevity.

%ive a short, self-contained summary of necessary
%ackground information. For example, assume you present an
%mplementation of sorting algorithms. You could organize into sorting
%efinition, algorithms considered, and asymptotic runtime statements. The goal of the
%ackground section is to make the paper self-contained for an audience
%s large as possible. As in every section
%ou start with a very brief overview of the section. Here it could be as follows: In this section 
%e formally define the sorting problem we consider and introduce the algorithms we use
%ncluding a cost analysis.

%mypar{Sorting}
%recisely define sorting problem you consider.

%mypar{Sorting algorithms}
%xplain the algorithm you use including their costs.

%s an aside, don't talk about "the complexity of the algorithm.'' It's incorrect,
%roblems have a complexity, not algorithms.
