\section{Conclusions}
The state mappings of the parallel transducer approach can be considered to
constitute a compressed representation of the original XML stream, similar to
our tokenstream. Analogous to the generation of the state mapping, our approach
scales linearly with the number of processors.

The effectiveness of the parallel transducer stems from the fact that the state
mappings can be efficiently traversed in the joining phase, which is necessarily
sequential. Likewise, we try to reduce memory traffic in the matching phase.

It is virtually impossible to make a direct comparison, as both a
reimplementation of the parallel transducer approach was outside of the scope of
this project and the experimental results stem from different hardware setups.
It can be argued, though, that our approach is less effective for a small number
of queries. However, we could demonstrate weak scalability for the query matcher
allowing for up to 60 queries (the number of cores) to run in parallel.

Furthermore, its straight-forward design lowers the cost of extensions to the
system and also makes it easier to analyze. For example, supporting a larger
subset of XPath merely introduces new tokens. Also, to further enhance
performance, different techniques to compress the tokenstream could be employed.
