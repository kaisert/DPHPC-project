\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:exp}

Here you evaluate your work using experiments. You start again with a
very short summary of the section. The typical structure follows.

\mypar{Experimental setup} Specify the platform (processor, frequency, maybe OS, maybe cache sizes)
as well as the compiler, version, and flags used. If your work is about performance, 
I strongly recommend that you play with optimization flags and consider also icc for additional potential speedup.

Then explain what kind of benchmarks you ran. The idea is to give enough information so the experiments are reproducible by somebody else on his or her code.
For sorting you would talk about the input sizes. For a tool that performs NUMA optimization, you would specify the programs you ran.

\mypar{Results}
Next divide the experiments into classes, one paragraph for each. In each class of experiments you typically pursue one questions that then is answered by a suitable plot or plots. For example, first you may want to investigate the performance behavior with changing input size, then how your code compares to external benchmarks.

For some tips on benchmarking including how to create a decent viewgraph see pages 22--27 in \cite{Pueschel:10}.

{\bf Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create very readable, attractive plots (do 1 column, not 2 column plots
for this report) with readable font size. However, the font size should also not be too large; typically it is smaller than the text font size.
An example is in Fig.~\ref{fftperf} (of course you can have a different style).
\item Every plot answers a question. You state this question and extract the
answer from the plot in its discussion.
\item Every plot should be referenced and discussed.
\end{itemize}

  discrete Fourier transform. The operations count is roughly the
  same. The labels in this plot are maybe a little bit too small.\label{fftperf}}
