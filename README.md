# Scalable XML Query Processing using Parallel Pushdown Transducers
Project of the lecture ''Design of Parallel and High Performance Computation'' at ETH ZÃ¼rich
## Goal
The goal of this project is to implement a way to query/parse large XML files or streams in parallel using pushdown transducers. The theoretical aspect of the work is provided by [Odgen et al](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1738-ogden.pdf). Target architecture is the Intel Xeon Phi using OpenMP.
